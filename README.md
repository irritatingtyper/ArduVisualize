# ArduVisualize

ArduVisualize is an Arduino data management application that allows users to collect, manage, and process data. It also has the ability to visualize data thanks to Chart.js.

# Status
This application is being restructured from the ground up. So you won't be hearing anything about this application anytime soon (maybe Q2 2023?).
