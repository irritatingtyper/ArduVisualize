# ArduVisualize

ArduVisualize is an Arduino data management desktop application that allows users to collect, manage, and process data. It also has the ability to visualize data thanks to Chart.js.

# Note
This application is **not** production-ready, as there are some vulnerabilities in the application. Use at your own risk

# Status
This application is being restructured from the ground up. So you won't be hearing anything about this application anytime soon (maybe Q2 2023?).
